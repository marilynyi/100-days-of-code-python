# Day 47: Amazon Price Tracker

Scrape a product on Amazon to send an email notification if the price dips below a desired threshold.

## The Amazon product
For this example, we use the [REDTIGER Dash Cam](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098WVKF19/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_1/131-6645546-7932634) on Amazon. This product is priced at $149.99 at the time of this project.

## Email notification
To test the alert, we set our desired price to be $150 or lower. Since the current price of $149.99 is below $150, we are alerted via email notification about this price dip.
