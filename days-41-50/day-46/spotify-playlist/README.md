# Day 46: Spotify Playlist

Scrape the Billboard Hot 100 list on a specific date and compile the songs into a Spotify playlist.

## Billboard Hot 100
We use the Billboard Hot 100 list on [April 1, 2000](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2000-04-01/) for this example. Any valid date in the past with the format YYYY-MM-DD will work.

## Creating the playlist
Some songs don't exist on Spotify due to streaming rights, country restrictions, or other reasons. While creating the Spotify playlist, we print the ones that don't make it onto the playlist in the terminal.

## Spotify Playlist
The scraping was not 100% correct. In the screenshot, the second song shows 'Ava Maria' by Maria Ferrante instead of 'Maria Maria' by Santana.
