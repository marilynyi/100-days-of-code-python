# Day 45: Top 100 Movies

Scrape the Empire Online's [Top 100 Movies](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/) list into a text file.

On Empire Online, the movie counts are in ascending order, while the movies listed by rank are in descending order. In other words, the list starts with movie #100 as `1 of 100` and ends at the bottom with the top movie as `100 of 100`. 

## Empire Online: #1 Movie shown as 100 of 100
