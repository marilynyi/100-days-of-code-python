# Day 76: Google Play Store App Analytics

We compare thousands of apps in the Google Play Store so that we can gain insight into:
- How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are
- Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity
- How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free
- How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app
- Which paid apps have had the highest revenue
- How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue
  
Learning objectives:
- How to quickly remove duplicates
- How to remove unwanted symbols and convert data into a numeric format
- How to wrangle columns containing nested data with Pandas
- How to create compelling data visualizations with the `plotly` library
- Create vertical, horizontal, and grouped bar charts
- Create pie and donut charts for categorical data
- Use color scales to make beautiful scatter plots
