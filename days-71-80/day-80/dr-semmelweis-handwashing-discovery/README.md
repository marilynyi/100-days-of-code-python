# Day 80: Dr. Semmelweis' Handwashing Discovery

In the 1800s, doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and making arguments based on data. Dr. Semmelwise suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. He wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever. We pinpoint the cause by taking a closer look at the data he collected on the number of births and maternal deaths throughout the 1840s and the procedural changes he made in regards to handwashing.
  
Learning objectives:
- Make a compelling argument using data
- Superimpose histograms to show differences in distributions
- Use a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to show a graphic estimate of a distribution
- Use scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values
- Highlight different parts of a time series chart in Matplotlib
- Add and configure a legend in Matplotlib
- Use NumPy's `.where()` function to process elements depending on a condition
