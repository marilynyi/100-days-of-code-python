# Day 75: Popularity of Search Terms

We combine Google Trends with other Time Series data to explore the popularity of search terms.

Learning objectives:
- How to make time-series data comparable by resampling and converting to the same periodicity (e.g., from daily data to monthly data)
- Fine-tuning the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linestyles, markers, colors, and the chart's resolution
- Using grids to help visually identify seasonality in a time series
- Finding the number of missing and NaN values and how to locate NaN values in a DataFrame
- How to work with Locators to better style the time axis on a chart
- Review the concepts learned in the previous three days and apply them to new datasets
