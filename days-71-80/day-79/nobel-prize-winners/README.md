# Day 79: Nobel Prize Winners

We analyze a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize and see what patterns we can uncover in the past Nobel laureates.
  
Learning objectives:
- Create a Choropleth to display data on a map
- Create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly
- Create Sunburst charts with plotly
- Use Seaborn's `.lmplot()` and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the `row`, `hue`, and `lowess` parameters
- Understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots vs. a time series analysis)
- See the distribution of our data and visualize descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn
