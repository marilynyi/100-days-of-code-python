# Day 26: NATO Alphabet

Have you ever called the customer service line at your bank or insurance company or even a retail store and the person on the line asked you how you spell your name? And sometimes when you spell it out, they confuse 'M' with 'N' or 'F' with 'S', etc.? 

Now you can use the [NATO alphabet](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_136216.htm) to spell your name out and avoid the confusion!
