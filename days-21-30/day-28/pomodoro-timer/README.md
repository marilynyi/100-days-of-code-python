# Day 28: Pomodoro Timer

Simple Pomodoro timer app to structure focus time and scheduled breaks.

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method used by many to effectively work on a task without distractions. The structure is as follows:

- 4 25-minute blocks of focused work separated by 5 minute breaks
- At the end of the 4th block, take a 15-30 minute break

or more simply,

- 25 min work
- 5 min break
- 25 min work
- 5 min break
- 25 min work
- 5 min break
- 25 min work
- 15-30 min break

Then repeat!
