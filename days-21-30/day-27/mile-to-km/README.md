# Day 27: Miles to Kilometers Conversion

Fun fact! The United States, Myanmar, and Liberia are the only three countries in the world that officially use the imperial system (miles, pounds, Fahrenheit, etc.) instead of the metric system (kilometers, kilograms, Celsius, etc.)

As our first step in moving with the global world, we convert miles to kilometers.

**Note**: After entering the number of miles, press `Return` or `Enter` on your keyboard instead of clicking the `Calculate` button with your mouse.
